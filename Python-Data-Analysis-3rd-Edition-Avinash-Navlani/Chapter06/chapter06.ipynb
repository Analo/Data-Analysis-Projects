    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this chapter, I learned how data is ubiquitous and comes in various formats and sources, such as:\n",
    "- Web, IoT sensors, emails, FTP, and databases.\n",
    "- Lab experiments, election polls, marketing polls, and social surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "I now understand the importance of handling diverse datasets as a critical skill for a data professional. This chapter helped me:\n",

    "### Using the sqlite3 Module in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The `sqlite3` module in Python is used to interact with SQLite databases. It provides tools to create, read, write, and manage databases efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing the Module**:\n",
    "    - Use `import sqlite3` to include the module in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Establishing a Connection**:\n",
    "    - Use the `connect()` method to create a connection to the database.\n",
    "    - Syntax: `conn = sqlite3.connect('database_name.db')`\n",
    "    - If the database does not exist, it will be created with the specified name and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating a Cursor Object**:\n",
    "    - Use the `cursor()` method on the connection object to create a cursor.\n",
    "    - Syntax: `cur = conn.cursor()`\n",
    "    - The cursor is used to execute SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Executing SQL Queries**:\n",
    "    - Use the `execute()` method on the cursor object to run SQL queries.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "      - Creating a table: `cur.execute(\"CREATE TABLE emp (eid INT, salary INT)\")`\n",
    "      - Inserting data: `cur.execute(\"INSERT INTO emp VALUES (105, 57000)\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Committing Changes**:\n",
    "    - Use the `commit()` method on the connection object to save changes to the database.\n",
    "    - Syntax: `conn.commit()`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fetching Data**:\n",
    "    - Use the `execute()` method with a `SELECT` query to retrieve data.\n",
    "    - Fetch methods:\n",
    "      - `fetchone()`: Retrieves a single record.\n",
    "      - `fetchall()`: Retrieves all records.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM emp\")\n",
    "      records = cur.fetchall()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The `sqlite3` module simplifies database operations in Python. It allows you to create and manage databases, execute SQL queries, and fetch data efficiently. Key methods include `connect()`, `execute()`, `commit()`, `fetchone()`, and `fetchall()`."
