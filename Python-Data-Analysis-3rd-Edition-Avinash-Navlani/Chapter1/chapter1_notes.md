NumPy: This is a short form of numerical Python. It is the most powerful
scientific library available in Python for handling multidimensional arrays,
matrices, and methods in order to compute mathematics efficiently.

SciPy: This is also a powerful scientific computing library for performing
scientific, mathematical, and engineering operations.

Pandas: This is a data exploration and manipulation library that offers tabular
data structures such as DataFrames and various methods for data analysis and
manipulation.

Scikit-learn: This stands for "Scientific Toolkit for Machine learning". It is a
machine learning library that offers a variety of supervised and unsupervised
algorithms, such as regression, classification, dimensionality reduction, cluster
analysis, and anomaly detection.

Matplotlib: This is a core data visualization library and is the base library for all
other visualization libraries in Python. It offers 2D and 3D plots, graphs, charts,
and figures for data exploration. It runs on top of NumPy and SciPy.

Seaborn: This is based on Matplotlib and offers easy to draw, high-level,
interactive, and more organized plots.

Plotly: Plotly is a data visualization library. It offers high quality and interactive
graphs, such as scatter charts, line charts, bar charts, histograms, boxplots,
heatmaps, and subplots.
